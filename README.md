# Ling Ling
Named in honors of our favorite [giant panda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ling_Ling_(giant_panda)), Ling-Ling aims to assist with tedious activities in [Ark Survival Ascended](https://ark.wiki.gg/wiki/ARK:_Survival_Ascended).
The bot is heavily based on [ASA++](https://github.com/kennyhml/ASAPP), a custom library written to deal with the ingame aspect of the activities i.e interacting with the game.

The project serves as a community project for the ASA community and contributions are very much welcome.
